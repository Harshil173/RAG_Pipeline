1)'What is the maximum allowed positional accuracy for Arm C, and what is its maximum joint temperature?'
Ans) Based on the provided document context, the maximum allowed positional accuracy for Arm C is ±0.25mm, and its maximum joint temperature is 75°C.

2)At what vibration threshold does the conveyor system trigger an emergency shutdown? Provide the exact number and source snippet.
Ans)Based on the provided context:

The conveyor system triggers an emergency shutdown at a vibration threshold of **1.2 g RMS**.

Source snippet: "vibration shutdown at 1.2 g RMS"

3)If a thermal sensor exceeds twice its accuracy threshold, what error code should be raised and what action is required?
Ans) Based on the provided context:
If a thermal sensor exceeds twice its accuracy threshold (±1.2°C), the error code **OUT_OF_CALIBRATION** should be raised. The context does not specify a required action beyond raising this error code.

4)What is the rule for robotic arm shutdown relating to joint temperature? Explain the exact condition and the allowed time window?.
Ans)I don't know.

5)Does the document allow a conveyor belt to continue running if lateral alignment drift is 4.0 mm? Yes/No. Provide citation.
Ans)No. The document states an "alignment tolerance ≤3.5 mm." A drift of 4.0 mm exceeds this tolerance, so the conveyor would not be allowed to continue running.

6)What is the maximum allowable deviation in the robot pick-place cycle time, and what event is triggered when this limit is exceeded?
Ans)Don't know.

7)For the "/v1/refund"-equivalent safety flow (Human in Zone A), what is the required response time for full stop?
Ans)Human in Zone A → stop ≤200ms.
